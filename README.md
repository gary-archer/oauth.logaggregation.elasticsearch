# OAuth Elasticsearch Log Aggregation

Resources for demo level deployments of the Elastic Stack, used for OAuth and API log aggregation.\
This is part of an overall [Effective API Logging](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.blog/tree/master/public/posts/effective-api-logging.mdx) design.

## Docker Commands

First ensure that a Docker engine is installed.

### Configure DNS and SSL

Configure custom development domains by adding this DNS entry to your hosts file:

```bash
127.0.0.1 localhost logs.authsamples-dev.com
```

Install OpenSSL 3+ if required, create a secrets folder, then create development certificates:

```bash
export SECRETS_FOLDER="$HOME/secrets"
mkdir -p "$SECRETS_FOLDER"
./certs/create.sh
```

Then configure [Browser SSL Trust](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.blog/tree/master/public/posts/developer-ssl-setup.mdx#trust-a-root-certificate-in-browsers) for the SSL root certificate at this location:

```text
./certs/authsamples-dev.ca.crt
```

### Deploy the System

Run the following command to deploy Docker components for Elasticsearch, Kibana and Filebeat:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The script waits for completion and then opens Kibana in the system browser.\
Sign in with a username of `elastic` and a password of `Password1`, then query API logs.

### Free Resources

Run the following command to free Docker resources:

```bash
./teardown.sh
```

/*
 * Elastic Stack Setup on a Linux host for Elasticsearch, Kibana and Filebeat
 * This runs the service under our interactive user account
 */

Download software and unzip under a root folder:
* /home/gary/logaggregation/elasticsearch-8.3.0/
* /home/gary/logaggregation/filebeat-8.3.0-darwin-x86_64/
* /home/gary/logaggregation/kibana-8.3.0-darwin-x86_64/

Set paths in service files in the current folder and copy them as root to this folder:
* /etc/systemd/system

Install agents, which will then run on every reboot:
* systemctl enable elasticsearch
* systemctl enable kibana
* systemctl enable filebeat

* systemctl daemon-reload

* systemctl start elasticsearch
* systemctl start kibana
* systemctl start filebeat

# Debug failures with these commands:
* journalctl -fxeu elasticsearch
* journalctl -fxeu kibana
* journalctl -fxeu filebeat

Unload if required:
* systemctl stop elasticsearch
* systemctl stop kibana
* systemctl stop filebeat

Check if running:
systemctl is-active elasticsearch
systemctl is-active kibana
systemctl is-active filebeat
